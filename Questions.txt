We will use Python to:

- Check how long do people travel with Uber?
- What Hour Do Most People Take Uber To Their Destination?
- Check The Purpose Of Trips
- Which Day Has The Highest Number Of Trips
- What Are The Number Of Trips Per Each Day?
- What Are The Trips In The Month
- The starting points of trips. Where Do People Start Boarding Their Trip From Most?

SECOND DATASETSS

1. Time-based Analysis:
    What time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) receives the most ride requests?
    Which day of the week has the highest number of ride requests?
    
2. Status-based Analysis:
    What percentage of requests are completed, canceled, or no-show?
    Are there certain pickup points where cancellations or "no-shows" are more common?
    What is the average wait time for completed vs. canceled requests?
    Which drivers have the highest rate of ride cancellations?
3. Driver-based Analysis:
    Which drivers have completed the most rides?
    What is the average time taken by each driver from request to drop?
    Which drivers are more likely to accept or cancel a request at different pickup points?
    Is there any driver who consistently gets higher 'no-show' status?
4. Pickup Point Analysis:
    Which pickup point has the highest number of requests?
    Is there a difference in ride completion rates between different pickup points?
    What is the average wait time for requests from different pickup points?
5. Request/Drop Time Efficiency:
    What is the average duration of a ride (difference between Request timestamp and Drop timestamp) for different pickup points?
